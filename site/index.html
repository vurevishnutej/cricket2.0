	<h2>Here are some reasons why cricket is the most popular and famous sport in India compared to any other sport</h2>

	<ol>
	<section id="section1">
	<li>Keep it simple silly </li>
	<p>
To play the game of cricket, you just need a bat and a ball and a minimum of two players can easily play the game. It can be played even in the smallest of smallest dimensions, like a road, a street ally or even in a room!
Reality check, in India the sport is so horribly popular amongst kids that they frequently play ‘gully cricket’ even in most congested streets!

<section id="section2">
<li>Better infrastructure </li>
<p>
Compared to other sports, cricket has more number of coaching centres in the entire country. This factor is hugely responsible in drawing more and more young children, who aspire to be future cricketers.
Similarly, almost in each and every state there is at least one world class cricket stadium present whereas if we take a peek into football and hockey, there are only a few FIFA accredited stadiums and genuine astroturfs respectively, present in India.

<section id="section3">
<li>A force to reckon with </li>
<p>
	India till now has won two ICC Cricket World Cups, two Champions Trophies, one T20 World Cup. Moreover, with years India’s performance in the cricketing arena has improved remarkably which undoubtedly makes India a reckoning force in today’s cricketing fraternity.

On the other hand, India used to excel in the game of hockey once but the country’s performance in the sport has dwindled gradually. If we talk about football, India could never really make any mark in the world of football. The current FIFA ranking of India is 156 out of the 208 FIFA accredited nations which is more than enough to signify the the poor state of Indian soccer.

<section id="section4">
<li>World class cricketers</li>
<p>India over the years have produced a bunch of world class cricketing legends who at some point or the other have taken the cricketing world by storm. Batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, captains consisting the likes of Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh to name a few. Their pictures and posters are pasted over walls and are idolized by numerous boys and girls.

<section id="section5">
<li>A strong governing body</li>
<p>Cricket in India is governed by BCCI, which is an efficient, rich, well-organized and systematic council. The BCCI, over the years have taken several constructive steps to protect and prosper the cricketing interests of India. It has been highly successful in establishing itself as a dominant body in world cricket.

<li>IPL factor</li>
<p>
	In 2008, when Lalit Modi first introduced this T20 extravaganza, it instantly became a huge sensation. Since then IPL has proved to be a game changer as well as a great money-spinner in the sporting history of the country. All the best cricket players from the world assembled in India to play this elite competition.
Moreover it gave the platform to the relatively unknown players to become a hero. And the amount of money and glamour involved in the competition, would draw any budding cricketer towards itself. The IPL has amplified the popularity of cricket to a gigantic level amongst the Indians as for now every budding cricketer wants to be a part of the greatest cricket show on earth.
Although now we have several parallel leagues like ISL, Hero Indian Hockey League, Indian Badminton League and so on, but they are nowhere near the fame or popularity of IPL.
